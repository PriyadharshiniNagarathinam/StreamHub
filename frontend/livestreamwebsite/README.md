Setup Connection: The live streamer (broadcaster) establishes a connection with the server using WebRTC or Socket.IO. This connection allows the broadcaster to send video/audio data to the server.

Encoding and Broadcasting: The live streamer captures video/audio from their device's camera/microphone and sends this data to the server. The server then broadcasts this data to all connected clients (viewers).

Viewing the Stream: The viewers connect to the server and receive the live stream data. They can watch the live stream in real-time.

Live Chat: Additionally, viewers can participate in a live chat associated with the live stream. Messages sent by viewers are also sent to the server and broadcasted to all connected clients.
